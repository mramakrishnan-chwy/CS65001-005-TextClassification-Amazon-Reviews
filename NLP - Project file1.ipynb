       "[\"I 've had this USB drive for about 3 months now , and I absolutely love it . I like to carry around my USB drives on my keychain , and durability has always been an issue . However , this device has a solid , all-metal construction , and an extremely handy and secure retracting mechanism . I get great performance from the drive as well . The U3 software can be helpful for some , although for me , I fail to find it as useful . Fortunately , Sandisk now provides a way to remove the bundled U3 software from the drive itself , turning it into a standard 2gb USB drive . There are cheaper 2gb flash drives out there , but none of them would last nearly as long as the Cruzer Titanium . For the quality that you get , the price simply cannot be beat .\\n\",\n",
       " \"The cords I purchases were indeed 3 ' and function properly . Be aware , however , that the cord pictured is NOT the item you will receive . The cord pictured is probably at least 7'-if you 're not careful and order by appearance , you will be disappointed . A 3 ' cord is good for connecting things that are right next to each other and little more .\\n\",\n",
       " \"This camera really is a waterproof pocket camera , and it removes worries of rain , sand , mud , or other substances getting into the camera and ruining it . Its very carefree in that way . Unfortunately , it does such a lousy job of exposing , focusing , and capturing that in place of your worry about rain damage is your new worry about capturing that special moment . I love virtually everything about this camera .. except the lousy picture quality . The camera looks great , feels nice , is easy to use , starts up quickly , and is of course waterproof . It fits easily in a pocket and the battery lasts for a reasonably long period of time . It even comes with a nice padded belt case . But after you have seen the results , all you will be thinking about as you frame that next shot is if you 'll get home and discover the picture you just took is so bad its unusable . Outside of bright , direct sunlight , I would guess that 50 % of the images from this camera are sub-standard . And half of those are so bad they are unusable . If you can live with those odds and you need a pocket camera that is waterproff , then you will like this camera . I honestly have had better , more consistent shots from a 2MP Fuji camera from 2001 than I have with the Optio .\\n\",\n",
       " \"I noticed these elevation feet are cheaper for mac version than pc version . Since they looked the same I went with the cheaper mac feet for my Alienware m17x . Here are the pros and cons : pros : 1 . Its straight forward to apply . Peel and stick2 . It does amazing job of keeping my laptop cool . My fans are working less because my laptop is venting very well . 3 . Very sleek and slim when folded down . For those that are not familiar with the Alienware m17x , its a beast of a computer in weight and size . I had to cut my laptop bag ( biggest laptop bag from bags . com ) with scissors to get my laptop to slide in . I was concerned adding these feet would make it worse . I was very pleasantly surprised when everything folded down and was able to fit in without a problem . Its elegant looking . 4 . Beefy . If this can survive 2years supporting the m17x , it will probably have no problem supporting any other laptop . cons : 1 . Matter of time until adhesive backing starts peeling off . But then again my laptop weighs like 15lbs . This can be fixed easily by using silicone . 2 . The rubber friction pad will eventually fall off . Again easy fix , just glue it back in . 3 . I should have paid extra for the black feet since white feet don't look good on the jet black alienware . How does one spend $ 5k on a laptop but cheaps out on little elevation feet ? .. I 'm shaking my head .\\n\",\n",

       " \"I purchased the little brother of this radio , the 120 , because it got good reviews . But then I had second thoughts because the 300 would let me select which alerts I wanted to attend to . ( Both models let me choose whcih counties I 'm interested in ) . Well , the 300 is going back . The LCD display on the 120 was very easy to read even with the back light off . But the display on the 300 is very dim unless you crouch down in front of it and view it at a low angle . I don't know whether mine was flawed or whether there 's an actual design issue .\\n\",\n",

I just opened these headphones and put them on , they feel good , not great but they dont hurt your head or your ears from long hours of having them on . The sound quality is so bad ! Everytime have it over 50 % volume it stars to crackle and distort . From previous experence this is nomaly what happens right before they speakers blow , its so poorly made ( from what other ppl have posted , i haven't cracked it open yet to look in side ) that im sure the power thats flowing through the copper ( if they even used copper ) coils is arking and shorting out the sound . if you want your music to sound good enought for you to enjoy DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES ! they suck ! the only good thing that i like obout them are how they look and the bottle opener that comes with it , i need to see if there is a way to return them . I 'm keeping the bottle opener though .\\n\",\n",
